### About me:
Let me introduce myself. I am twenty six years old. I was born in Postawy, but now live in Minsk.
I do not have commercial experience, but I hope that I can compensate for this with my desire for work. Now I am developing my skills in working with ECMAScript 6, React.
I also study English. I did not know English before. I studied German at School. I am going to improve my skills not only in English, but also in an IT sphere.
